Temporary home for the new PolySPS.

## Goals
Three modes, selective, lotto and preferential lotto.

Selective allows students to pick each presentation they wish to see, in a first come first serve fashion.

Lotto allows students to enter their information, later all students are randomly placed in presentations.

Preferential lotto allows students to declare what presentations they'd prefer to see, later students are placed in presentations based on their preferences. There will also be the ability to give certain grades/houses priority over others.
